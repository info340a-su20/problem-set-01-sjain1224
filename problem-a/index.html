    <p>
        Burton "Gus" Guster is played by Dule Hill on the TV show Psych. He is the other owner of the "Psychic" agency known as Psych, 
        along with Shawn Spencer, the main character of the show. He acts a support system (and often the voice of reason) in the pair. 
        To get an in-depth look on who Gus is, take a look at <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_(Psych)">this Wikipedia page</a> </cite>
    </p>
    <p>The reasons I admire Gus are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>He often acts as a voice of reason to make sure Shawn doesn't end up in jail himself</li>
        <li>During Shawn's hard moments, he is always there to support Shawn and help him get through whatever, whether its Ying and Yang or others</li>
        <li>Without his random knowledge, a lot of cases would probably not be solved</li>
        <li>The Blueberry! (and super sniffer)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I hope you all learned a bit about Gus and appreciate how much he gives to the show! Also as a side note, Psych 2: Lassie Come Home! is out on Peacock TV for free!</p>
